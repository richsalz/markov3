.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Markov3
digests Usenet articles and builds an internal data structure that
models the articles as if they came from a random process, where
each word is determined by the previous two.  It then emits a series
of articles on the standard output that have the same distribution
of words, word pairs, and word triplets as do the input files.
The name
.I markov3
comes from the fact that this structure is called a Markov chain,
and that the statistics for word triplets are modeled.
Here, a "word" is a sequence of printable characters surrounded by
whitespace.  Paragraph breaks (blank lines) are also treated as a
"word".  Paragraphs of included text are treated as single "words"
and printed as "> ...".
.PP
To filter the input files, use the
B \-f
(filter) option.  This is a command, invoked with popen(3) on each file.
There should be a single
.B %s
string to indicate where the filename goes.
.PP
By default, 10 articles, separated by form feeds, are written on the
standard output.  The
.B \-n
(number) option lets you specify a different number.
.PP
The
.B \-v
(verbose)
option prints some statistics on the standard error.
